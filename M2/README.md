## Information of `build.gradle`

```
dependencies {
    compile files('lib/resources.jar')
}
```
This is for compiling.

```
jar {
    manifest {
        attributes 'Main-Class': 'edu.gatech.oad.antlab.pkg1.AntLabMain',
                   'Class-Path': 'resources.jar'
    }
}
```
This is for compiled jar file.

In this configuration, since we specified `'Class-Path': 'resources.jar'`, `resources.jar` should be copied to the same directory as the jar file generated by `gradle jar` to make it runable.
